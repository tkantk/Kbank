                            text="Reiterated Its Monetary Easing Policy. Aluminium closed up by 1.07% at 230.4, boosted by China's central bank reaffirming its supportive monetary policy stance aimed at economic stability. Despite this positive sentiment, gains were constrained by indications of ample supply and subdued demand pressures. Inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange increased by 2.0% week-on-week, underscoring ongoing supply dynamics. In the US, Manufacturing PMI rose to a three-month high of 51.7 in June, exceeding expectations and indicating modest expansion in the sector. However, China opted to maintain its key lending rates unchanged, reflecting limited scope for further monetary easing amid narrowing interest rate margins and a weakening currency. Globally, primary aluminium production climbed 3.4% year-on-year to 6.1 million tons in May, according to the International Aluminium Institute. China specifically saw a robust 7.2% increase in aluminium production to 3.65 million tons in May compared to a year ago, contributing to a cumulative production of 17.89 million tons in the first five months of the year, up 7.1% from the previous year. China's aluminium imports surged by 61.1% year-on-year in May, driven by increased shipments from Russia, despite Western sanctions affecting Russian metal exports. This influx included 310,000 metric tons of unwrought aluminium and products last month alone, with significant imports continuing from Russia throughout the year. Technically, the aluminium market saw short covering with a 2.69% decrease in open interest to 4,333, coupled with a price increase of 2.45 rupees. Currently, aluminium is supported at 228.8, with potential downside testing towards 227.2 if support levels are breached. Resistance is expected at 231.9, with potential upward movement towards 233.4 upon breaching resistance levels, highlighting the current technical outlook.
